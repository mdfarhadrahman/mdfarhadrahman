# --- Farhad Ahmed ---
## Mission-driven Software Engineer with a passion for thoughtful collaboration, and teaching.

I am Farhad Ahmed from Bangladesh, and I am starting a new learning journey. So my main goal is comparative programming. I just started my new journey today. I'm very excited to achieve my new goal. May God bless me to achieve my goal. I enjoy learning new languages and developing, in general, my knowledge.

I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. Although my professional path has taken many twists and turns — I've never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve problems.

I wish one day As a Software Engineer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to change the world. That's why I’m excited to make a big impact at a high-growth company.

# --- Farhad Ahmed ---
## Mission-driven Software Developer with a passion for thoughtful UI design, collaboration, and teaching.

I'm Farhad Ahmed from Bangladesh, and I do content on Design and Development. I enjoy learning languages and frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.JS and working in software development. I also enjoy learning new languages and developing in general.

I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. Although my professional path has taken many twists and turns — from touring and recording artist, to employee of the year at a non-profit, to dean's scholar at UPenn, to small business owner and entrepreneur — I've never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve problems.

As a software developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to change the world. That's why I’m excited to make a big impact at a high-growth company.
